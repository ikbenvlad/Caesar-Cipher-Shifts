# Caesar-Cipher-Shifts

This is some really bad python code for making an encryptor and decryptor. The encryption type is a Cipher Shift, with the key being 1 (meaning a=b b=c c=d ect). Don't use it because it's actually really bad lol.

Other than that I made an HTML code fro the exact same idea, that being the cipher shift. That one is a bit better though.
